## Welcome
According to tradition, Christianity in India was established by St. Thomas who arrived in Malankara (Kerala) in A.D. 52.
The church in Malankara is an integral part of the Syrian Orthodox Church with the Patriarch of Antioch,
His Holiness Moran Mor Ignatius Aphrem II as its supreme head. The local head of the church in Malankara
is the Catholicose of India, His Beatitude Aboon Mor Baselios Thomas I, ordained by and accountable to the Patriarch of Antioch.

The Malankara Jacobite Syrian Orthox Church members living in U.K. forms the Malankara Jacobite Syrian Orthodox Church in U.K.
(MSOC-UK) under the Patriarchal Vicar and Metropolitan of Malankara Syrian Orthodox Churches in U.K. and Ireland, His Grace Mathews Mor Antheemos. Our church is one of the parishes
under MSOC-UK. Our parish is named after St.Mary.
